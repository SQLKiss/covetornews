Once upon a time, I traveled through time and landed in the year 2023 (06/04). As I was catching up on the news, I stumbled upon some interesting headlines.

The first one that caught my attention was about Caitlin Clark, a young basketball player who had recently received criticism for her performance. Despite the negativity, she spoke out and defended herself, even receiving an invitation to the White House for her bravery.

Next, I read about a tragic incident in Nashville where a shooter had taken innocent lives. When the police searched the shooter's home, they found a suicide note and weapons, shedding light on the shooter's mental state and motive.

On a lighter note, I came across a review of the Super Mario Bros. movie. As a fan of the classic video game, I was excited to see how it translated onto the big screen. The review from IGN was mixed, but I decided to watch it for myself and form my own opinion.

Lastly, I read about the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Finland had formally joined NATO, becoming the 31st member. This move was seen as a strategic move to counter Russia's aggression in the region.

As I was about to move on to the next news article, I saw that Rupert Murdoch's engagement with Ann Lesley Smith had been called off. The reason for the split was unknown, but it was clear that even the rich and famous have their own struggles and heartbreaks.

With all these stories in mind, I realized that no matter what time period I traveled to, there would always be a mix of good and bad news. But it was up to us to focus on the positive and make a difference in the world.
